### Assumed Settings

Some of these commands list alt as a prefix character. This is because I have manually set alt as a meta key. Without this setting enabled you have to use the esc key instead. I recommend enabling the alt key. In Mac Terminal.app this setting is Preferences > Profiles tab > Keyboard sub-tab > at the bottom "Use option as meta key." In iTerm2 the setting is at Preferences > Profiles tab > Keys sub-tab > at the bottom of the window set "left/right option key acts as" to "+Esc". In GNOME terminal Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts > uncheck "Enable menu access keys."
I also assume you're using bash. I know there are some cool newcomers out there like zsh and fish, but after trying others out I always found that some of my utilities were missing or ill-replaced. If you are not using bash then YMMV.
I also assume you are using at least bash version 4. If you're on a Mac then, unless you have manually installed bash with homebrew, you are using an old version. Install bash with homebrew and include it in /etc/shells.
