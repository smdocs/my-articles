# Mathematics - The Un(solv)able Problem
> Three mathematicians have discovered that a problem of central importance to
  physics - [the spectral gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_gap) is impossible to solve.

  Mathematicians tried to explore the connections between the mathematical results by Kurt Godel, Alan Turing 
  and Quantum Physics. The main problem was to explore these mathematical results in order to determine
  whether certain problems in physics are 'decidable' or 'undecidable'.

  ### Spectral Gap
  If you heat up a substance it begins to glow as atoms within it emits light, the yellow orange light from
  the sodium street lights is a good example. Sodium atoms emit lights at a wavelength of 590 nanometers in 
  the yellow part of the visible spectrum.
  Atoms absorb or release light when electrons within them jump from one discrete energy level to another and
  the precise frequency of the light depends on the <b>gap</b> between the energy levels.

  The frequency of the light emitted from heated materials thus give us a map of the gaps between atom's
  different energy levels.

  Hence the <b>spectral gap</b> is the jump in energy between the ground state and the first excited 
  state of the atom.

In some materials there is large gap between the ground state and the first excited state, in other materials
this gap is almost seem less and these energy levels extends all the way to the ground state. Whether a material
is 'gapped' or 'gap less' it has profound implications on its property and behaviour in low temperatures.

When ice melts to water, a distinct 'phase transition' takes place and the material undergoes a dramatic change
in its properties. But there are *****quantum phase transitions*** that occur when the temperature is kept extremely low
E.g. changing the magnetic field around a material can transform it from an insulator to a super conductor or cause
a solid to become a ***superfluid**

### How can a material go through a phase transition at a temperature of absolute zero (-273.15 Celsius) at which 
### there is no heat at all to provide any energy?
### It comes down to the Spectral Gap.
When a material is 'gapless' the energy needed to reach an excited state is alomost zero. Any tiniest amount of 
energy can push the material through a phase transition.
